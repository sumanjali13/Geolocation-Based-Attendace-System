# Geolocation-Based-Attendace-System

Geolocation-Based Attendance Tracking Mobile Application

📌 Problem Statement

Organizations with multiple office locations face significant challenges in accurately recording employee attendance. Manual tracking systems are prone to errors, fraud, and inefficiencies. Employees working offsite add further complexity, making it difficult to ensure fair and accurate attendance logs.

🎯 Aim

To develop a mobile application that automates attendance tracking using geolocation technology, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and seamless user experience.

🛠️ Proposed Solution

We propose a cross-platform mobile app (Flutter) backed by a cloud-based backend (Firebase/Firestore or Supabase) that enables:

Geolocation-Based Check-In & Check-Out:

Automatic attendance marking when employees enter or exit a 200-meter geofence around office premises.

Each check-in is automatically paired with a corresponding check-out.

Manual Location Check-In/Check-Out (for Offsite Work):

Employees can manually check-in/out when working outside offices.

The app suggests relevant nearby locations using real-time GPS coordinates, which the user can confirm.

Total Working Hours Calculation:

The system automatically calculates daily working hours by pairing all IN/OUT events.

Handles multiple in/out cycles, overnight work, and missing OUT cases.

Data Accuracy & Integrity:

Tamper-proof attendance logs with server-side distance verification.

Real-time synchronization with offline queueing and background sync.

Secure storage and immutable audit trails for reliability and compliance.

📊 Key Features

🔐 Secure authentication (Firebase Auth / OAuth).

📍 Geofencing for auto-check-in/out.

🗂️ Multi-site management (different office branches).

📱 Offline support with automatic sync.

📑 Admin dashboard for reports & CSV exports.

🛡️ Anti-spoofing with mock location detection & server-side validation.

🖥️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Flutter (cross-platform)

Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions) / Supabase (alternative)

Database: Firestore (NoSQL) or Postgres (if Supabase)

APIs: Cloud Functions for attendance validation & reporting

Maps & Location: Google Maps API + Geolocator

🚀 Future Enhancements

Selfie/Face verification at check-in.

Shift scheduling with late/early leave detection.

QR-code + geofence double-verification.

Analytics dashboards with AI-based anomaly detection.

👉 This project enhances operational efficiency, reduces human error, and ensures accurate & secure attendance tracking across multiple sites.
